# Guardian API Pagination Task

This task demonstrates how to interact with The Guardian Open Platform API using Python, with a focus on:

* Making API requests
* Handling pagination
* Managing API errors & unexpected response formats
* Writing clean and maintainable code
* Using GitHub for version control

Submitting work through a CI-enabled pull-request workflow

# Task
You’re to write a Python script that extracts data from the Guardian API on the Russia–Ukraine war (or any topic you choose). The script must handle pagination properly to fetch all pages of results, include exception handling, and follow best coding practices.
You should push the project to GitHub, follow a CI pipeline (formatting checks), and submit via a pull request so comments can be made before merging.
